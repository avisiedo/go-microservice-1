# Build http

https://github.com/api1st/httprun

The intents of this directory is to find a way to build the tool from the above
directory in a multi-arch container, and extract the binary build (or directly
build or copy the resulting file in a mounted volume), so we make the built
binary available from the ./tools/bin/ directory for the developers of our
repository.
